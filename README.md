# Hero Manager 2016

The code compiled with browserify/watchify goes into the dist directory, this
will run in latest chrome and is good for rapid development.

Using compile.sh to generate es5 transpiled code into the **build** directory,
which should run in most modern browsers.

Using `npm run-script deploy` will push the build directory to s3  if you have
a valid s3conf.json file present in the root of the projects directory.
